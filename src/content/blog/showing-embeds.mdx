you can show embeds in your blog posts for youtube and link cards.

simply write a youtube url in your post like this (with nothing else on the same line):

```mdx
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

or any other url for a link card like this (again with nothing else on the same line):

```mdx
https://flo-bit.dev
```
