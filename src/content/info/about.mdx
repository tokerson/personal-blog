Iâ€™m a frontend developer with a passion for crafting smooth, high-performance web experiences. Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked with React, Typescript, and a bunch of other cool tech to build scalable and efficient applications. I love diving into performance optimization, accessibility, and testingâ€”because great apps should be fast, inclusive, and rock-solid!

I have experience leading teams and designing the architecture of large-scale applications using micro frontends and custom-built npm packages.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me out sailing, watching Formula 1, or geeking out over the latest frontend trends.
